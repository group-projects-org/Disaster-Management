## Key Features
- **Demand Prediction**: Forecast high-demand areas during disasters
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize allocation of emergency resources
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous model updates with new data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track model accuracy and drift

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up your data in the `data/` folder
3. Run preprocessing: `python src/preprocessing/data_processor.py`
4. Train models: `python src/training/train_models.py`
5. Evaluate performance: `python src/evaluation/evaluate_models.py`

## Data Requirements
- Historical disaster data
